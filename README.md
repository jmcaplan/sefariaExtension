# Jastrow Jackpot Google Chrome Extension
*A project for Sefaria Hackathon, Summer 2020*

## About
This project is a Chrome browser extension for sefaria.org, that utilizes the [Sefaria API](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/wiki/API-Documentation#sefaria-apis) and enables the user to search a hebrew word in the Jastrow Aramaic Dictionary, and receive not only the relevant definitions, but also a special message if the user has stumbled upon a 'Jastrow Jackpot' - when an example of the word's usage that the dictionary references matches the source currently being learned (in this case, the source one has open in sefaria.org). 

## How to install
To install the extension, open a Chrome browser and go to chrome://extensions/ and click on 'Load unpacked'. For the folder, choose the appropriate folder from this repository, e.g. v1/chrome_extension
